This project uses Bayesian Gaussian Processes to model municipal bond yield curves. Municipal bonds are often overlooked compared to other types of bonds and are usually modeled with deterministic models that don't perform well with the limited data that is available. This project demonstrates how Bayesian Gaussian Process Regression can be applied to uncover yield curve dynamics and inherent uncertainty even with limited data.

The approach generalizes to other fixed-income instruments and bond datasets beyond municipal bonds.
